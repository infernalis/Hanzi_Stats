History
-------

This is a modified version of the Anki Hanzi Stats plugin that could previously be found at:

https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/296672579

This version includes modifications by Trevor L. Davis:

    1. Fix some typos 
    2. Got rid of the HSK A, HSK B, HSK E, and HSK I categories (whatever they were)
    3. Only looks for characters in the first field instead of all fields.
    4. The New HSK character lists has been updated from the 2010 version to the 2012 version.
    5. The 6000 most frequently characters in the original plugin have been replaced by the list created by Dr. Sharoff.  
    6. Additionally clicking character links now sends you to hanzicraft.com instead of dict.cn.

This plugin was originally written by Ben Lickly based on Japanese Stats by Damien Elmes.  This modified version also includes a couple modified code snippets from the Chinese Support plugin by Roland Sieker and Thomas Tempe (which was also based on a plugin by Damien Elmes).

The plugin is available under the GNU GPL, version 3 or later;  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html
